            My first week of this bootcamp has not gone as I expected. There was a large amount of information that
            needed to be unpacked in the onboarding section. I didn't expect it to take me as long as it did. I also did
            not think we would get into git and terminal use, since I thought we would jump straight into HTML and CSS.
            However, this was extremely valuable for me since I have not had much experience in git. I learned how to
            implement git into my daily programming routine, improving my workflow.
            <br> <br>
            My only struggle is having to wake up at 6 a.m. every day to take my daughter to daycare. Besides that, the
            coding has gone smoothly ­– especially when I am able to get in the zone. I am kind of excited to get the
            prework over with and start meeting up with everyone and getting to know everyone better. I am also excited
            to start diving into other languages and libraries like Javascript, React, PHP, and SQL.
