        Bootcamp Week 1: Prework
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        My first week for pre-work of the bootcamp went less of how I expected it. There was a large amount of information that needed to be unpacked in the onboarding section which I didn't expect to take me as long as it did. I also did not think we would get into git and terminal use. Since I thought we would jump straight into HTML and CSS. But this was extremly valuable for me since my use of git has been minor in the past. Now I have been able to learn and implment git into my daily programming routine which has been useful.
        <br> <br>
        Moving onto struggles the only one I am having the is waking up at 6 a.m. everyday. But besides that the "coding" has gone smoothly espcially when I am able to get in the zone. I am kinda excited to get the prework over with and start meeting up with everyone and getting to know everyone better. Also starting to dive deep into other languages and libraries like Javascript, React, PHP, and SQL.
